	<h2>Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann Magee</h2>
	<p>The exhibition, Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann Magee, includes examples of the artist's work
		created concurrently with the title series (2001–2011) that illustrate the strengths of her approach. Although
		Magee's first ventures into quilting had expressed affirmative emotions toward domestic life, she understood the
		toughness of the subjects she chose to address as her narrative direction developed, and did not flinch from the use
		of powerful imagery. "I am fully aware," she blogged in 2009, "that the dissonance is palpable between this medium
		through which my art finds expression and the subject matter that it articulates. I know that the quilt form usually
		is associated with feelings of warmth, comfort, serenity and security and that my subject matter often is harsh,
		intense, somber and frequently brutal. However, viewers of the art frequently convey to me that they find the work to
		be compelling, evocative, meaningful and riveting."<a id="footnoteref12_6fit7gp" href="07.html#footnote12_6fit7gp">[12]</a></p>
	<p>"Shocking Quilts: We Show You the Controversial Patchwork" read the cover of a 2009 <a
			href="http://www.quiltershomemag.com/index.html">Quilter's Home</a> magazine that included some of Magee's narrative
		works. The Washington Post commented on the resulting kerfuffle over censorship after a few traditional quilt shops,
		including the <a href="http://www.joann.com/">Jo-Ann Fabrics</a> chain, refused to carry the issue:</p>
	<q>Some of the images are disturbing—and moving—like quilter Gwen Magee's Southern Heritage/Southern Shame,
		which depicts five lynching victims hanging in front of a Confederate flag. . . . Magee says that the contrast between
		her soft fabrics and her harsh social messages is exactly what makes her work effective. She did see a letter from one
		guy protesting her quilts, asking, 'Who would want to cuddle under such a thing?' 'He had no concept that this wasn't
		that kind of quilt,' Magee says.<a id="footnoteref13_8pmrrfm" href="07.html#footnote13_8pmrrfm">[13]</a></q>
	<h3>Southern Heritage/Southern Shame</h3>
	<q>This was my response to the failure of a referendum to remove the Confederate battle emblem from the Mississippi
		state flag.</q>

	<p>This multilayered quilt, with its narrative elements and use of transparencies to create layers of meaning, is now in
		the collection of the <a href="http://museum.msu.edu/">Michigan State University Museum</a>. The Confederate battle
		flag is overlaid with silhouettes of lynched bodies, but the left side of the work is deceiving—at first glance
		viewers may try to blink away a fog or a smudge. But suddenly, through Magee's skilled use of materials, a figure
		emerges and the shadowy, hooded figure leaps into view.</p>

	<p>The <a href="http://msmuseumart.org/">Mississippi Museum of Art</a> commissioned Five Years Hard Labor for <a
			href="http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2007/dec/12/gwendolyn-magee/">The Mississippi Story</a>, a selection of
		more than three hundred objects from its permanent collection of work by artists from around the state. Magee's
		narrative features one notorious element of Mississippi history, a chain gang, in a highly textured work.</p>
	<p>This work combines techniques and design elements characteristic of Magee's style: diversely textured fabrics,
		intense color to enhance the mood, and heavy threadwork. The threadwork (often created with free motion machine
		embroidery) builds up textures in layers and helps unify the surfaces across a body of work, just as a painter's
		brushwork can become a style signature.</p>
	<p>As in Five Years Hard Labor, human figures in Magee's work often appear as featureless profiles, reminiscent of <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romare_Bearden">Romare Bearden</a>'s pictorial narratives. The postures and
		apparel of the chain gang figures identify their status.</p>
	<p>Magee's use of spiral elements lends universality to her compositions. The angry sun, an agitated disc in the chain
		gang quilt, combines shape, motion, and intense color to emphasize the scene's heat. A spiraling background texture
		echoes the sun.</p>
	<h3>Requiem</h3>
	<q>This is a lament for a vibrant city that will never again be the same with the devastation wreaked by Hurricane
		Katrina compounded by the indifference and ineptitude of our government.</q>
	<p>—Gwen Magee</p>

	</a>

	<p>Requiem represents another example of Magee's reactions to current events, and was the beginning of a planned series
		about <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/hurricane-katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> and its aftermath. Magee
		completed only two pieces in this series. Family ties in New Orleans and keen attachments to the city, coupled with
		growing horror at government failures to deal with an overwhelming natural and manmade disaster drove the creation of
		this work. Requiem combines references to musical culture, a street corner significant to Magee's family, and the
		encroaching floodwaters where streams of music pouring from the trumpet meet and blend with streams of water flowing
		through broken levees.</p>
	<p>Multiple details—the variety of specialty and hand-dyed fabrics mimicking decorative ironwork, window glass,
		the musician's alligator shoes, and the luminosity of a street lamp—enhance the strengths of the Katrina
		narrative told in one vignette. Heavy thread work suggests layers of architectural and cultural history on a typical
		street corner. The featureless figure of a musician propped against a street lamp stands in as a cultural icon. The
		spiral elements make their appearance, but in this work they are distorted and their perpetual motion diverted. On
		first glance, an arched doorway appears to frame rich shadows and coloring achieved with intense thread work that,
		when examined, emerge from the background as a montage of abstract images—a spiraling hurricane, rampaging
		water, a levee break—framed by an architectural feature.</p>
	<h3>Expendable Cargo</h3>
	<q>Slavers continued to operate even after importation of slaves became illegal. However, if the patrol ships were
		bearing down on them on the high seas, the illegal cargo was unceremoniously dumped overboard to drown - if no slaves
		were found on board there would be no imprisonment or fines.</q>

	<p>On completion of Lift Every Voice, Magee began another African American history series. Expendable Cargo is
		representative of this body of work depicting harrowing facets of enslavement—here, the jettisoning of human
		cargo to rid a pursued ship of incriminating bodies. The shape of the quilt emphasizes the descending human figures,
		weighted and dragged downward by restraints, silhouettes shackled together, sinking through the depths of blue waves.
	</p>
	<p>Expendable Cargo, part of <a href="http://actipedia.org/project/slave-series-quilts-gwendolyn-magee">Slavery
			Series</a>, in the collection of the Mississippi Museum of Art is composed of quilts that are generally smaller in
		format and treated with less visual complexity than other Magee works. Again, Slavery Series' figures are featureless.
		Each represents a story of slavery told and retold. The surfaces are not as intensely worked, but the graphic
		qualities are inescapably direct. Some of the work moves toward sculptural adaptations that extend from the surface.
		Intensely experienced by the artist and viewers, images and narratives pour from Magee's Slavery Series, as if she
		seems compelled to create them as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p>Deep Into the Woods, one of Magee's later works, offers a purely sculptural means of telling a story, and represents
		an increasing transition from two-dimensional wall work into representations with more depth. This aptly named
		category of handmade objects is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_book#Tunnel_books">tunnel
			book</a>. Using this multi-dimensional format, Magee layered in story elements, capturing a chilling moment in the
		deep woods. The stylized spiral foliage frames a hooded figure peering out from the depths, backed up by flames, an
		empty noose, and the Confederate battle flag. While Magee created many pieces that incorporated layers—using
		transluscent and sculpted fabrics, along with machine stitching—she found that the tunnel book format enabled
		her to express with actual (as opposed to illusive) depth the layers of meaning and imagery characteristic of her
		work.</p>

	<h3>Verse One: Lift Every Voice</h3>
	<p>The title series of this exhibition draws its inspiration from the majestic words and music of "Lift Every Voice and
		Sing." The song's lyrics are a major legacy from James Weldon Johnson, and a crucial contribution to the
		twentieth-century struggle for civil rights. Johnson's achievements in many fields were acknowledged in the 2007
		creation of Emory University's <a href="http://www.jamesweldonjohnson.emory.edu/">James Weldon Johnson Institute</a>,
		but "his place in African American history and culture would be secure if he had composed only in 1900 with J.
		Rosamond Johnson 'Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing,' a hymn officially adopted by the National Association for the
		Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and widely sung by African Americans as the Negro National Anthem."<a
			id="footnoteref14_2ki31oi" href="07.html#footnote14_2ki31oi">[14]</a></p>
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bond">Julian Bond</a> and <a
			href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/starnewsonline/obituary.aspx?pid=144175333">Sondra Kathryn Wilson</a>
		articulated the power of "Lift Every Voice" in the introduction to their book of tributes on the 100th anniversary of
		the song's creation:<a id="footnoteref15_qh59s3j" href="07.html#footnote15_qh59s3j">[15]</a> "It is wondrous and hardly explicable to many," wrote Bond
		and Wilson, "how James Weldon Johnson could have written such spiritually enriching lyrics in 1900 . . . 'Lift Every
		Voice and Sing' is fittingly provocative. Yet its message, ingeniously crafted, does not fuel the fires of racial
		hatred."<a id="footnoteref16_mo7htf3" href="07.html#footnote16_mo7htf3">[16]</a></p>
	<p>Magee's Lift Every Voice series translates the song's verbal images into powerful visuality. Images from words
		embedded in life experience were shared through well-developed skills that conveyed both the history and the passion
		of shared time and participation. " I had mental pictures inspired by the words," recalled Magee's longtime friend
		Edith Wiggins, "and when I saw Gwen's series my reaction was, 'Yes—that's exactly what I was thinking.' The
		series helps to validate and underscore what you've always felt and visualized."<a id="footnoteref17_qmin3u7" href="07.html#footnote17_qmin3u7">[17]</a>
	</p>
	<p>In a 2007 interview, Magee summed up her wishes that her legacy be "a body of work that not only is meaningful but is
		compelling, through its use of color, design, and/or subject matter—so that the viewer is not only engaged but
		is drawn into the work and, hopefully, back to it repeatedly."<a id="footnoteref18_k1ibbr5" href="07.html#footnote18_k1ibbr5">[18]</a></p>
	<q>Lift every voice and sing<br /> Till earth and heaven ring<br /> Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;<br /> Let our
		rejoicing rise<br /> High as the listening skies,<br /> Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.</q>
	<h3>Lift Every Voice and Sing</h3>
	<q>The full color spectrum not only of African-Americans, but of all peoples of the world is depicted. All should be
		able to find themselves represented.</q>
	<p>—Gwen Magee</p>

	<p>In her title piece to the series, Magee uses a spectrum of skin colors to introduce her wish to cross boundaries that
		separate humankind. The featureless profiles lift their voices, eyes, and heads.</p>
	<p>The placement of the globe and text in a night sky, enhanced with sparkling stars and a texture of meander quilting
		suggesting swirling galaxies, connects this title piece to the "<a
			href="http://life.time.com/history/blue-marble-apollo-17-photo-of-earth-from-space/#1">the blue marble</a>"<a
			id="footnoteref19_28cie8g" href="07.html#footnote19_28cie8g">[19]</a> perspective of earth, as viewed from space. The rainbow of faces lifted in hope,
		and the implied voices lifted in song convey Magee's hope for a universe that will "ring with the harmonies of
		liberty."</p>
	<h3>Full of the Faith</h3>
	<q>Three women kneel in the shadow of the cross to indicate their submission to the will of a higher power. This piece
		conveys the important role played by religion during slavery and reconstruction.</q>

	<p>Multilayered in technique and meaning, this work depicts the centrality of faith in African American culture.
		Identified by their profiles and postures as a young woman, a mature woman, and an older woman, the three kneeling
		figures are iconic for their generational span and for their strength. These three figures, although flat fabrics, are
		visually contoured with the use of linear work that is an internal echo of the outlines shapes. The cross, with its
		African-patterned textiles, casts a protective shadow on the trio.</p>
	<p>The cross rises from a richly embroidered billow of threadwork in deep and varied reds with gold overlays, a tour de
		force of surface work. The sheer beauty of this background belies reference to the smoldering and smoking remains of
		another form of burning cross all too familiar to African American history—another lesson of "the dark past."
	</p>
	<h3>Full of the Hope</h3>
	<q>Youth and education have long been very powerful symbols of hope for African-Americans with education viewed as our
		road map for making it into 'the promised land'.</q>
	<p>—Gwen Magee</p>

	<p>Full of the Hope invokes the potential of education. With its open, serious faces and uplifted eyes, this is one of
		only three pieces in the exhibition that do not portray figures in featureless profile. The young man and woman in cap
		and gown and with diplomas in hand, stand in the light of golden rays. Magee believed fervently in the power of
		education, and spoke frequently to school groups as a part of her artistic mission.The graduation gowns are adorned
		with stoles emblematic of racial pride.</p>
	<h3>Our New Day Begun</h3>
	<q>A blazing sun symbolizes hope.</q>
	<p>—Gwen Magee</p>

	<p>The climax of the first stanza of Johnson's anthem is the title phrase for Magee's Our New Day Begun. A geometrically
		complex sun shines forth from a hand-dyed background, its luminosity enhanced with intricate lines of shading from
		meander lines of variegated thread work. The rising sun of this text is not the angry, spiraling sun of other works,
		but a glowing symbol of purpose and belief in the future.</p>
