	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<q>The art flows through me, but does not belong to me alone. It speaks for those who have no voices, whose voices
			have been ignored, whose voices have been silenced. It relates history and circumstances that must not be
			forgotten.</q>
	<p>—Gwendolyn Ann Magee, Artist</p>
	<q>Rarely does an individual who has experienced oppression and prejudice find the means of expressing her experience
		with such masterful skill, in such an appropriate medium, and with such an embracing, uplifting tone.<a

	<p>An extraordinary artist working in fiber, Gwendolyn Ann Jones Magee (1943–2011) produced powerful abstract and
		narrative works in the medium of quilts. Magee's art, which she came to in midlife, was informed by her childhood in a
		creative home, her education in the social sciences, participation in the civil rights movement, careers in social
		work and business, and her experiences as a wife, mother, and grandmother.</p>
	<p>A native of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Point,_North_Carolina">High Point</a>, North Carolina, Magee
		lived most of her adult life in Mississippi. Educated in the public schools of High Point, she graduated from the <a
			href="http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-newsouth/5500">Woman's College of the University of North
			Carolina</a> (WCUNC), now the <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/">University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a> (UNCG).
		This essay, exhibition, and accompanying programming sponsored by the art department of UNCG brings Magee home and
		helps to raise awareness of her work. In the same spirit of homecoming, the <a href="http://highpointmuseum.org/">High
			Point Museum</a> will exhibit selections of Magee's work following the Greensboro exhibition, December 5,
		2014–February 21, 2015.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.uncg.edu/art/exhibitions/gatewood.html">Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann
			Magee</a> features twelve works based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Weldon_Johnson">James Weldon
			Johnson</a>'s transformative lyrics, set to music by his brother <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Rosamond_Johnson">John Rosamond Johnson</a>, and often referred to as "The
		Negro National Anthem." The quilt exhibition and this essay feature the twelve pieces as a cohesive body of work in
		narrative sequence. The exhibition also includes selected works that emphasize Magee's development through the
		expression of her social concerns and the evolution of her technical skills.</p>

	<p>Magee's childhood and early adult years in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_Triad">Triad</a> area
		of North Carolina contributed to the passionate voice she brought to her art. <a
			href="http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/search/collection/OralHisCo/field/creato/searchterm/Wiggins,%20Edith%20Mayfield/mode/exact">Edith
			Mayfield Wiggins</a>, a childhood and college friend, remembers young Gwen Jones spinning endless stories and
		imaginative flights of fancy.<a id="footnoteref2_zn7he0m" href="07.html#footnote2_zn7he0m">[2]</a> Hers was a childhood surrounded by art publications
		and crafts in various media, and included museum trips to New York with her adoptive mother, schoolteacher Annie Lee
		Jones.<a id="footnoteref3_rs5ixhm" href="07.html#footnote3_rs5ixhm">[3]</a> Fascinated with color, Magee recalled trying to dig into paper with crayons
		to achieve the depths and intensities that could match the pure hues in her mind's eye.<a
			id="footnoteref4_hkk0t47" href="07.html#footnote4_hkk0t47">[4]</a> The power of color became a signature of her mature work.</p>
	<p>Another influence throughout Magee's childhood and youth that affected her later work was the pervasive presence of
		"Lift Every Voice and Sing":</p>

	<q>I well remember singing it at the beginning of almost every elementary and high school assembly program and at
		community activities. . . . It speaks to our heritage of slavery and oppression, as well as of our hope for equality,
		freedom, and justice.<a id="footnoteref5_jglc2ki" href="07.html#footnote5_jglc2ki">[5]</a>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I grew up with this song. It's been a major part of my life. All the way through school, we would sing it in
		assemblies, and sometimes daily in some of my classes. I can remember from about the age of four going with my mother
		to community programs or events and hearing it. For me, it's a powerfully emotional song, because it deals with pride,
		cultural heritage, and a clear recognition of all the difficulties African Americans have faced over the centuries.<a

	<p></p>
	<p>In the fall of 1959, Gwen Jones, as a new graduate from William Penn High School in High Point, entered the Woman's
		College of the University of North Carolina in nearby Greensboro. Three years earlier JoAnne Smart and Betty Ann Davis
		had broken the color barrier at the all-white women's school. Although there were not violent protests or
		grandstanding in the schoolhouse door, the transition was not easy. Alice Joyner Irby, the newly appointed director of
		admissions, recalls touring the state, "searching for other black women who could succeed at WC. The women needed to
		be tough, smart, and ambitious to withstand the volatile culture they'd potentially face."<a
			id="footnoteref7_5rzlbsu" href="07.html#footnote7_5rzlbsu">[7]</a> By the time Jones and her four freshman cohorts arrived on campus they found
		themselves segregated in one section of one dormitory, and the target of discrimination, both subtle and not.<a
			id="footnoteref8_y197bi7" href="07.html#footnote8_y197bi7">[8]</a> The school was desegregated but not fully integrated.</p>

	<p>During Gwen Jones's college years, 1959–1963, Greensboro was a center of civil rights activities, best known as
		the site of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins">Woolworth's sit-ins</a> initiated by four <a
			href="http://www.ncat.edu/">North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University</a> (A&amp;T) students<a
			id="footnoteref9_uc45ie7" href="07.html#footnote9_uc45ie7">[9]</a> in February 1960. Advised by WCUNC administrators not to participate in the local
		demonstrations, between 1962–1964 Jones along with other students, black and white, targeted businesses adjacent
		to the campus and eventually prevailed in integrating the neighborhood movie theater and restaurants. Full integration
		did not occur until after she had graduated.</p>
	<p>In a 1990 interview, Dr. M. Elaine Burgess, one of Magee's most influential professors in her major, sociology,
		recalled the action:</p>
	<q>The kids were the ones that were doing it. They were brave. And they were so disciplined because they were frightened
		'cause the Ku Klux Klan would come rolling up. They were never in danger, but they didn't know. You know, those early
		days—those young southern girls. That was a pretty big step. . . . I felt they did a nice job. And they
		organized it.<a id="footnoteref10_apfq23u" href="07.html#footnote10_apfq23u">[10]</a></q>
	<p>After her 1963 graduation with a BA in sociology, Jones continued graduate study in social science at <a
			href="http://www.kent.edu/">Kent State</a> and <a href="http://wustl.edu/">Washington</a> universities, working as
		an assistant with various research projects. She did not pursue a graduate degree, but took a fieldwork assignment.
		All of these experiences helped sharpen the consciousness that would inform her art.</p>
	<p>In 1969 Gwen married Dr. D. E. Magee, an ophthalmologist she met during fieldwork in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. After
		Dr. Magee completed his residency in Philadelphia, the couple moved to Jackson, Mississippi, where they established
		careers and raised their two daughters, Kamili and Aliya. Although she had continued during the passing years to
		practice a variety of craft media while employed with Xerox, Merrill Lynch, and other corporate and minority placement
		programs, Magee decided in 1989 that she should learn to quilt in order to create reminders of home for her
		college-bound daughters. She discovered her artistic voice in the <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_art">fiber arts</a>, swiftly mastering quilting and surface design
		techniques through which she powerfully expressed herself and engaged an audience.</p>

	<p>Gwen Magee's first works in traditional quilting soon moved into abstract designs, and then references to African
		culture through the use of textile and design traditions. She reveled in and fine-tuned her fascination with the
		intensity and interplay of color. As she developed her skills, techniques, composition, and color management, she was
		also laying the groundwork for a transition in subject matter. As she studied quilting periodicals she discovered the
		narrative work of other <a href="http://www.quilting-in-america.com/African-American-Quilts.html">African American
			quilters</a>, which inspired a growing dissatisfaction with her own work as lacking in cultural relevance and
		significance. The artist challenged herself to create work satisfying to an audience of one, herself, responding to
		her need to deal with her own history and heritage. Her vision expanded to include her concern with social justice and
		African American heritage in the creation of extraordinary textile narratives.<a id="footnoteref11_ql8k4xx" href="07.html#footnote11_ql8k4xx">[11]</a></p>
