	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p>In this online exhibition catalog, Dorothy Moye presents and comments upon the textile art of Gwendolyn Ann Magee
		(1943–2011). This catalog accompanies the exhibition at the Gatewood Gallery of the University of North Carolina
		at Greensboro (September 11–November 8, 2014). Magee's extraordinary work includes a series of vivid, often
		harrowing, narrative quilts based on James Weldon Johnson's anthem "Lift Every Voice and Sing."</p>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p><em>The art flows through me, but does not belong to me alone. It speaks for those who have no voices, whose voices
			have been ignored, whose voices have been silenced. It relates history and circumstances that must not be
			forgotten.</em></p>
	<p>&mdash;Gwendolyn Ann Magee, Artist</p>
	<p>Rarely does an individual who has experienced oppression and prejudice find the means of expressing her experience
		with such masterful skill, in such an appropriate medium, and with such an embracing, uplifting tone.<a

	<p>An extraordinary artist working in fiber, Gwendolyn Ann Jones Magee (1943–2011) produced powerful abstract and
		narrative works in the medium of quilts. Magee's art, which she came to in midlife, was informed by her childhood in a
		creative home, her education in the social sciences, participation in the civil rights movement, careers in social
		work and business, and her experiences as a wife, mother, and grandmother.</p>
	<p>A native of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Point,_North_Carolina">High Point</a>, North Carolina, Magee
		lived most of her adult life in Mississippi. Educated in the public schools of High Point, she graduated from the <a
			href="http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-newsouth/5500">Woman's College of the University of North
			Carolina</a> (WCUNC), now the <a href="http://www.uncg.edu/">University of North Carolina at Greensboro</a> (UNCG).
		This essay, exhibition, and accompanying programming sponsored by the art department of UNCG brings Magee home and
		helps to raise awareness of her work. In the same spirit of homecoming, the <a href="http://highpointmuseum.org/">High
			Point Museum</a> will exhibit selections of Magee's work following the Greensboro exhibition, December 5,
		2014–February 21, 2015.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.uncg.edu/art/exhibitions/gatewood.html">Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann
			Magee</a> features twelve works based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Weldon_Johnson">James Weldon
			Johnson</a>'s transformative lyrics, set to music by his brother <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Rosamond_Johnson">John Rosamond Johnson</a>, and often referred to as "The
		Negro National Anthem." The quilt exhibition and this essay feature the twelve pieces as a cohesive body of work in
		narrative sequence. The exhibition also includes selected works that emphasize Magee's development through the
		expression of her social concerns and the evolution of her technical skills.</p>

	<p>Magee's childhood and early adult years in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piedmont_Triad">Triad</a> area
		of North Carolina contributed to the passionate voice she brought to her art. <a
			href="http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/search/collection/OralHisCo/field/creato/searchterm/Wiggins,%20Edith%20Mayfield/mode/exact">Edith
			Mayfield Wiggins</a>, a childhood and college friend, remembers young Gwen Jones spinning endless stories and
		imaginative flights of fancy.<a href="#footnote2_zn7he0m">2</a> Hers was a childhood surrounded by art publications
		and crafts in various media, and included museum trips to New York with her adoptive mother, schoolteacher Annie Lee
		Jones.<a href="#footnote3_rs5ixhm">3</a> Fascinated with color, Magee recalled trying to dig into paper with crayons
		to achieve the depths and intensities that could match the pure hues in her mind's eye.<a
			href="#footnote4_hkk0t47">4</a> The power of color became a signature of her mature work.</p>
	<p>Another influence throughout Magee's childhood and youth that affected her later work was the pervasive presence of
		"Lift Every Voice and Sing":</p>
	<p>I well remember singing it at the beginning of almost every elementary and high school assembly program and at
		community activities. . . . It speaks to our heritage of slavery and oppression, as well as of our hope for equality,
		freedom, and justice.<a href="#footnote5_jglc2ki">5</a></p>
	<p>I grew up with this song. It's been a major part of my life. All the way through school, we would sing it in
		assemblies, and sometimes daily in some of my classes. I can remember from about the age of four going with my mother
		to community programs or events and hearing it. For me, it's a powerfully emotional song, because it deals with pride,
		cultural heritage, and a clear recognition of all the difficulties African Americans have faced over the centuries.<a

	<p>Interview with Gwen Magee and Larry Morrisey. Personal interview. Jackson, Mississippi, March 29, 2007. Gwen
		discusses the difficulty of capturing color and how she found her medium.</p>
	<p>In the fall of 1959, Gwen Jones, as a new graduate from William Penn High School in High Point, entered the Woman's
		College of the University of North Carolina in nearby Greensboro. Three years earlier JoAnne Smart and Betty Ann Davis
		had broken the color barrier at the all-white women's school. Although there were not violent protests or
		grandstanding in the schoolhouse door, the transition was not easy. Alice Joyner Irby, the newly appointed director of
		admissions, recalls touring the state, "searching for other black women who could succeed at WC. The women needed to
		be tough, smart, and ambitious to withstand the volatile culture they'd potentially face."<a
			href="#footnote7_5rzlbsu">7</a> By the time Jones and her four freshman cohorts arrived on campus they found
		themselves segregated in one section of one dormitory, and the target of discrimination, both subtle and not.<a
			href="#footnote8_y197bi7">8</a> The school was desegregated but not fully integrated.</p>

	<p>During Gwen Jones's college years, 1959–1963, Greensboro was a center of civil rights activities, best known as
		the site of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greensboro_sit-ins">Woolworth's sit-ins</a> initiated by four <a
			href="http://www.ncat.edu/">North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University</a> (A&amp;T) students<a
			href="#footnote9_uc45ie7">9</a> in February 1960. Advised by WCUNC administrators not to participate in the local
		demonstrations, between 1962–1964 Jones along with other students, black and white, targeted businesses adjacent
		to the campus and eventually prevailed in integrating the neighborhood movie theater and restaurants. Full integration
		did not occur until after she had graduated.</p>
	<p>In a 1990 interview, Dr. M. Elaine Burgess, one of Magee's most influential professors in her major, sociology,
		recalled the action:</p>
	<p>The kids were the ones that were doing it. They were brave. And they were so disciplined because they were frightened
		'cause the Ku Klux Klan would come rolling up. They were never in danger, but they didn't know. You know, those early
		days&mdash;those young southern girls. That was a pretty big step. . . . I felt they did a nice job. And they
		organized it.<a href="#footnote10_apfq23u">10</a></p>
	<p>After her 1963 graduation with a BA in sociology, Jones continued graduate study in social science at <a
			href="http://www.kent.edu/">Kent State</a> and <a href="http://wustl.edu/">Washington</a> universities, working as
		an assistant with various research projects. She did not pursue a graduate degree, but took a fieldwork assignment.
		All of these experiences helped sharpen the consciousness that would inform her art.</p>
	<p>In 1969 Gwen married Dr. D. E. Magee, an ophthalmologist she met during fieldwork in Mound Bayou, Mississippi. After
		Dr. Magee completed his residency in Philadelphia, the couple moved to Jackson, Mississippi, where they established
		careers and raised their two daughters, Kamili and Aliya. Although she had continued during the passing years to
		practice a variety of craft media while employed with Xerox, Merrill Lynch, and other corporate and minority placement
		programs, Magee decided in 1989 that she should learn to quilt in order to create reminders of home for her
		college-bound daughters. She discovered her artistic voice in the <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_art">fiber arts</a>, swiftly mastering quilting and surface design
		techniques through which she powerfully expressed herself and engaged an audience.</p>

	<p>Gwen Magee's first works in traditional quilting soon moved into abstract designs, and then references to African
		culture through the use of textile and design traditions. She reveled in and fine-tuned her fascination with the
		intensity and interplay of color. As she developed her skills, techniques, composition, and color management, she was
		also laying the groundwork for a transition in subject matter. As she studied quilting periodicals she discovered the
		narrative work of other <a href="http://www.quilting-in-america.com/African-American-Quilts.html">African American
			quilters</a>, which inspired a growing dissatisfaction with her own work as lacking in cultural relevance and
		significance. The artist challenged herself to create work satisfying to an audience of one, herself, responding to
		her need to deal with her own history and heritage. Her vision expanded to include her concern with social justice and
		African American heritage in the creation of extraordinary textile narratives.<a href="#footnote11_ql8k4xx">11</a></p>
	<h2>Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann Magee</h2>
	<p>The exhibition, Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann Magee, includes examples of the artist's work
		created concurrently with the title series (2001–2011) that illustrate the strengths of her approach. Although
		Magee's first ventures into quilting had expressed affirmative emotions toward domestic life, she understood the
		toughness of the subjects she chose to address as her narrative direction developed, and did not flinch from the use
		of powerful imagery. "I am fully aware," she blogged in 2009, "that the dissonance is palpable between this medium
		through which my art finds expression and the subject matter that it articulates. I know that the quilt form usually
		is associated with feelings of warmth, comfort, serenity and security and that my subject matter often is harsh,
		intense, somber and frequently brutal. However, viewers of the art frequently convey to me that they find the work to
		be compelling, evocative, meaningful and riveting."<a href="#footnote12_6fit7gp">12</a></p>
	<p>"Shocking Quilts: We Show You the Controversial Patchwork" read the cover of a 2009 <a
			href="http://www.quiltershomemag.com/index.html">Quilter's Home</a> magazine that included some of Magee's narrative
		works. The Washington Post commented on the resulting kerfuffle over censorship after a few traditional quilt shops,
		including the <a href="http://www.joann.com/">Jo-Ann Fabrics</a> chain, refused to carry the issue:</p>
	<p>"Some of the images are disturbing&mdash;and moving&mdash;like quilter Gwen Magee's Southern Heritage/Southern Shame,
		which depicts five lynching victims hanging in front of a Confederate flag. . . . Magee says that the contrast between
		her soft fabrics and her harsh social messages is exactly what makes her work effective. She did see a letter from one
		guy protesting her quilts, asking, 'Who would want to cuddle under such a thing?' 'He had no concept that this wasn't
		that kind of quilt,' Magee says."<a href="#footnote13_8pmrrfm">13</a></p>

	<p>The <a href="http://msmuseumart.org/">Mississippi Museum of Art</a> commissioned Five Years Hard Labor for <a
			href="http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/news/2007/dec/12/gwendolyn-magee/">The Mississippi Story</a>, a selection of
		more than three hundred objects from its permanent collection of work by artists from around the state. Magee's
		narrative features one notorious element of Mississippi history, a chain gang, in a highly textured work.</p>
	<p>This work combines techniques and design elements characteristic of Magee's style: diversely textured fabrics,
		intense color to enhance the mood, and heavy threadwork. The threadwork (often created with free motion machine
		embroidery) builds up textures in layers and helps unify the surfaces across a body of work, just as a painter's
		brushwork can become a style signature.</p>
	<p>As in Five Years Hard Labor, human figures in Magee's work often appear as featureless profiles, reminiscent of <a
			href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romare_Bearden">Romare Bearden</a>'s pictorial narratives. The postures and
		apparel of the chain gang figures identify their status.</p>
	<p>Magee's use of spiral elements lends universality to her compositions. The angry sun, an agitated disc in the chain
		gang quilt, combines shape, motion, and intense color to emphasize the scene's heat. A spiraling background texture
		echoes the sun.</p>
	<h3>Requiem</h3>
	<p>This is a lament for a vibrant city that will never again be the same with the devastation wreaked by Hurricane

	<p>Requiem represents another example of Magee's reactions to current events, and was the beginning of a planned series
		about <a href="http://www.history.com/topics/hurricane-katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> and its aftermath. Magee
		completed only two pieces in this series. Family ties in New Orleans and keen attachments to the city, coupled with
		growing horror at government failures to deal with an overwhelming natural and manmade disaster drove the creation of
		this work. Requiem combines references to musical culture, a street corner significant to Magee's family, and the
		encroaching floodwaters where streams of music pouring from the trumpet meet and blend with streams of water flowing
		through broken levees.</p>
	<p>Multiple details&mdash;the variety of specialty and hand-dyed fabrics mimicking decorative ironwork, window glass,
		the musician's alligator shoes, and the luminosity of a street lamp&mdash;enhance the strengths of the Katrina
		narrative told in one vignette. Heavy thread work suggests layers of architectural and cultural history on a typical
		street corner. The featureless figure of a musician propped against a street lamp stands in as a cultural icon. The
		spiral elements make their appearance, but in this work they are distorted and their perpetual motion diverted. On
		first glance, an arched doorway appears to frame rich shadows and coloring achieved with intense thread work that,
		when examined, emerge from the background as a montage of abstract images&mdash;a spiraling hurricane, rampaging
		water, a levee break&mdash;framed by an architectural feature.</p>
	<h3>Expendable Cargo</h3>
	<p>Slavers continued to operate even after importation of slaves became illegal. However, if the patrol ships were
		bearing down on them on the high seas, the illegal cargo was unceremoniously dumped overboard to drown - if no slaves
		were found on board there would be no imprisonment or fines.</p>

	<p>On completion of Lift Every Voice, Magee began another African American history series. Expendable Cargo is
		representative of this body of work depicting harrowing facets of enslavement&mdash;here, the jettisoning of human
		cargo to rid a pursued ship of incriminating bodies. The shape of the quilt emphasizes the descending human figures,
		weighted and dragged downward by restraints, silhouettes shackled together, sinking through the depths of blue waves.
	</p>
	<p>Expendable Cargo, part of <a href="http://actipedia.org/project/slave-series-quilts-gwendolyn-magee">Slavery
			Series</a>, in the collection of the Mississippi Museum of Art is composed of quilts that are generally smaller in
		format and treated with less visual complexity than other Magee works. Again, Slavery Series' figures are featureless.
		Each represents a story of slavery told and retold. The surfaces are not as intensely worked, but the graphic
		qualities are inescapably direct. Some of the work moves toward sculptural adaptations that extend from the surface.
		Intensely experienced by the artist and viewers, images and narratives pour from Magee's Slavery Series, as if she
		seems compelled to create them as quickly as possible.</p>

	<p>Deep Into the Woods, one of Magee's later works, offers a purely sculptural means of telling a story, and represents
		an increasing transition from two-dimensional wall work into representations with more depth. This aptly named
		category of handmade objects is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop-up_book#Tunnel_books">tunnel
			book</a>. Using this multi-dimensional format, Magee layered in story elements, capturing a chilling moment in the
		deep woods. The stylized spiral foliage frames a hooded figure peering out from the depths, backed up by flames, an
		empty noose, and the Confederate battle flag. While Magee created many pieces that incorporated layers&mdash;using
		transluscent and sculpted fabrics, along with machine stitching&mdash;she found that the tunnel book format enabled
		her to express with actual (as opposed to illusive) depth the layers of meaning and imagery characteristic of her
		work.</p>

	<h3>Verse One: Lift Every Voice</h3>
	<p>The title series of this exhibition draws its inspiration from the majestic words and music of "Lift Every Voice and
		Sing." The song's lyrics are a major legacy from James Weldon Johnson, and a crucial contribution to the
		twentieth-century struggle for civil rights. Johnson's achievements in many fields were acknowledged in the 2007
		creation of Emory University's <a href="http://www.jamesweldonjohnson.emory.edu/">James Weldon Johnson Institute</a>,
		but "his place in African American history and culture would be secure if he had composed only in 1900 with J.
		Rosamond Johnson 'Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing,' a hymn officially adopted by the National Association for the
		Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and widely sung by African Americans as the Negro National Anthem."<a
			href="#footnote14_2ki31oi">14</a></p>
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Bond">Julian Bond</a> and <a
			href="http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/starnewsonline/obituary.aspx?pid=144175333">Sondra Kathryn Wilson</a>
		articulated the power of "Lift Every Voice" in the introduction to their book of tributes on the 100th anniversary of
		the song's creation:<a href="#footnote15_qh59s3j">15</a> "It is wondrous and hardly explicable to many," wrote Bond
		and Wilson, "how James Weldon Johnson could have written such spiritually enriching lyrics in 1900 . . . 'Lift Every
		Voice and Sing' is fittingly provocative. Yet its message, ingeniously crafted, does not fuel the fires of racial
		hatred."<a href="#footnote16_mo7htf3">16</a></p>
	<p>Magee's Lift Every Voice series translates the song's verbal images into powerful visuality. Images from words
		embedded in life experience were shared through well-developed skills that conveyed both the history and the passion
		of shared time and participation. " I had mental pictures inspired by the words," recalled Magee's longtime friend
		Edith Wiggins, "and when I saw Gwen's series my reaction was, 'Yes&mdash;that's exactly what I was thinking.' The
		series helps to validate and underscore what you've always felt and visualized."<a href="#footnote17_qmin3u7">17</a>
	</p>
	<p>In a 2007 interview, Magee summed up her wishes that her legacy be "a body of work that not only is meaningful but is
		compelling, through its use of color, design, and/or subject matter&mdash;so that the viewer is not only engaged but
		is drawn into the work and, hopefully, back to it repeatedly."<a href="#footnote18_k1ibbr5">18</a></p>
	<p>Lift every voice and sing<br /> Till earth and heaven ring<br /> Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;<br /> Let our
		rejoicing rise<br /> High as the listening skies,<br /> Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.</p>
	<h3>Lift Every Voice and Sing</h3>
	<p>The full color spectrum not only of African-Americans, but of all peoples of the world is depicted. All should be
		able to find themselves represented.</p>
	<p>&mdash;Gwen Magee</p>

	<p>In her title piece to the series, Magee uses a spectrum of skin colors to introduce her wish to cross boundaries that
		separate humankind. The featureless profiles lift their voices, eyes, and heads.</p>
	<p>The placement of the globe and text in a night sky, enhanced with sparkling stars and a texture of meander quilting
		suggesting swirling galaxies, connects this title piece to the "<a
			href="http://life.time.com/history/blue-marble-apollo-17-photo-of-earth-from-space/#1">the blue marble</a>"<a
			href="#footnote19_28cie8g">19</a> perspective of earth, as viewed from space. The rainbow of faces lifted in hope,
		and the implied voices lifted in song convey Magee's hope for a universe that will "ring with the harmonies of
		liberty."</p>
	<h3>Full of the Faith</h3>
	<p>Three women kneel in the shadow of the cross to indicate their submission to the will of a higher power. This piece
		conveys the important role played by religion during slavery and reconstruction.</p>

	<p>Multilayered in technique and meaning, this work depicts the centrality of faith in African American culture.
		Identified by their profiles and postures as a young woman, a mature woman, and an older woman, the three kneeling
		figures are iconic for their generational span and for their strength. These three figures, although flat fabrics, are
		visually contoured with the use of linear work that is an internal echo of the outlines shapes. The cross, with its
		African-patterned textiles, casts a protective shadow on the trio.</p>
	<p>The cross rises from a richly embroidered billow of threadwork in deep and varied reds with gold overlays, a tour de
		force of surface work. The sheer beauty of this background belies reference to the smoldering and smoking remains of
		another form of burning cross all too familiar to African American history&mdash;another lesson of "the dark past."
	</p>
	<h3>Full of the Hope</h3>
	<p>Youth and education have long been very powerful symbols of hope for African-Americans with education viewed as our

	<p>Full of the Hope invokes the potential of education. With its open, serious faces and uplifted eyes, this is one of
		only three pieces in the exhibition that do not portray figures in featureless profile. The young man and woman in cap
		and gown and with diplomas in hand, stand in the light of golden rays. Magee believed fervently in the power of
		education, and spoke frequently to school groups as a part of her artistic mission.The graduation gowns are adorned

	<p>The climax of the first stanza of Johnson's anthem is the title phrase for Magee's Our New Day Begun. A geometrically
		complex sun shines forth from a hand-dyed background, its luminosity enhanced with intricate lines of shading from
		meander lines of variegated thread work. The rising sun of this text is not the angry, spiraling sun of other works,
		but a glowing symbol of purpose and belief in the future.</p>

	<p>Moving into a second verse, Johnson's anthem turns toward history, as does Magee's imagery. She does not avoid the
		terrors of slavery as she translates words to visuals.</p>
	<p>A variegated deep red background and profiled black feet suggest the bloody treks of shackled slaves traveling to
		unknown destinations, before and after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage">Middle Passage</a>.
		The horizontal format of the quilt emphasizes the distance of these treks over perilous terrain. Interior contour
		lines emphasize the three-dimensiality of the trudging feet.</p>
	<h3>Bitter the Chastening Rod</h3>

	<p>The flat plane of two-dimensional artwork cannot contain the emotions of When Hope Unborn Had Died. An anguished
		mother, weighed down by a heavy cotton sack, screams across the unfolding scene. A parasol obscures the couple that
		has purchased her child, as a high stepping horse moves their carriage, cart, and cargo diagonally toward the edge of
		the frame, soon to disappear.</p>
	<p>The action originates in the viewers' space as the three-dimensional sack of <a
			href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/video/the-cotton-economy-and-slavery/">cotton</a>
		drags out of the picture plane and anchors the mother in a powerless dimension. Viewers who approach this work are
		drawn into the narrative and to the figure whose futile scream floats above the carriage. Her featureless profile with
		its screaming mouth echoes the cries of countless mothers during generations of American slavery.</p>
	<p>The use of fabrics as identifiers is particularly strong here. The slave mother wears rough cloth resembling the
		homespun of field work; the cotton sack is of burlap. The shielding parasol is of shiny, luxury cloth; the dappled
		horse is an irregularly dyed fabric; and the sun is a shiny, intense yellow. The stark, stylized tree with its
		unnatural spiral foliage echoes the angry sun.</p>
	<p>Yet with a steady beat,<br /> Have not our weary feet<br /> Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?<br /> We
		have come over a way that with tears has been watered</p>
	<h3>We Have Come Over a Way That with Tears Has Been Watered</h3>
	<p>A slave ship plunges through ocean waters. Blazing in the sky the sun depicts the turmoil of the voyage. Slave trade
		routes are depicted by the quilting lines connecting Africa and the United States.</p>

	<p>A slave ship in full sail splitting the waters of the Atlantic evokes the Middle Passage in Over a Way that with
		Tears Has Been Watered. The atmosphere echoes the turmoil of the human cargo; a spinning sun of judgment emits jagged
		rays, filling the dark sky as turbulent waters crash the ship's hull.</p>
	<p>The white sails billow and propel the ship through deep waters. The sails and the hold of the ship, with the telltale
		name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Amistad">Amistad</a>, are surrounded by a nest of tangled white
		threadwork, suggesting the rising miasma of misery.</p>
	<p>Almost obscured in the chaos is the relentless path of map lines indicating slave voyages connecting Africa in the
		upper right corner to the Americas in the lower left.</p>
	<h3>Blood of the Slaughtered I and II</h3>
	<p>"Treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered . . ." The words haunted me for months&mdash;reverberating in
		my head over and over again; nine little words embodying a multiplicity of possible interpretations. But one meaning
		in particular resonated mercilessly. This single line . . . gripped me at the deepest core of my being and left me
		with no refuge.</p>

	<p>Out from the gloomy past,<br /> Till now we stand at last<br /> Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast</p>
	<h2>Verse Three: God of Our Weary Years</h2>
	<p>God of our weary years,<br /> God of our silent tears,</p>
	<p>As African Americans, just as we have so much hope for our youth to 'lead the way' and to 'fulfill the dream,' we
		also have to daily face the reality that for countless reasons many of our youth, particularly if they are male and
		teenagers,somehow wind up being touched by the criminal justice system. This piece speaks to that issue.</p>

	<p>God of Our Silent Tears I takes viewers into the execution chamber, where the life force of a condemned man fades,
		marked by the receding image of his body as an overhead hand throws the switch to the electric chair. Magee has chosen
		to give this figure an African American face and not portray him as a featureless profile. The tableau reminds viewers
		that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States">capital punishment in America</a>
		imposes unequal racial judgment in society's name.</p>
	<h3>God of Our Silent Tears II</h3>
	<p>This companion piece looks at execution from another perspective&mdash;that of the family being left behind, for
		they, too, will suffer. Each of the three newspapers shown takes a different position&mdash;one is against capital
		punishment and also questions the politics of the trail and whether or not this man was railroaded for political
		reasons. Another paper takes the position that the evidence clearly proved his guilt and that he therefore should be
		executed.The third takes a middle of the road point of view.</p>

	<p>As the family of a condemned man waits, and the clock nears the appointed hour of midnight, God of Our Silent Tears
		II portrays the other side of the execution scene, that of the "family being left behind."</p>
	<h3>Thou Who Has Brought Us</h3>
	<p>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;<br /> Thou who has by Thy might<br /> Led us into the light,<br /> Keep
		us forever in the path, we pray.<br /> Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,<br /> Lest,
		our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;<br /> Shadowed beneath Thy hand,<br /> May we forever
		stand.<br /> True to our God,<br /> True to our native land.</p>
	<p>Gwen Magee's series doesn't interpret the final lines of Lift Every Voice, but could be reprised by the hope
		expressed in Our New Day Begun. The spirit of Magee's work&mdash;informed by history but not overwhelmed by
		sorrow&mdash;complements the anthem that inspired her throughout her life.</p>

	<p>Infinity, the last quilt in the narrative sequence of Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann Magee,
		voices the joy Gwen Magee knew in her life, the love she experienced for her family and friends, and the legacy of her
		work. Early in the chronology of her work in fiber, Magee created Infinity as a Christmas gift for her husband, D. E.
		Magee. Just beginning to flex her creative muscles, she worked from a traditional quilt pattern that she altered to
		celebrate Dr. Magee's serious hobby of astronomy and his profession as an ophthalmologist.</p>

	<p>Infinity glows with intensity of color and precise geometry, successfully moving light across the surface while
		creating illusions of dimension through the manipulation of color and form. Dr. Magee's insistence that this was a
		work of art for the wall and not a bed covering marked a turning point from which Gwen Magee recognized and identified
		herself as an artist.</p>
	<p>Curator Ren&eacute; Barilleaux, who worked with Magee on her exhibition, Journey of the Spirit, at the Mississippi
		Museum of Art, sums up her life in the arts: "Gwen Magee was a rare combination of artist, advocate, and gentle
		spirit. In her life and in her art, she made monumental statements on those things about which she cared deeply."<a
