	<h2>Verse Three: God of Our Weary Years</h2>
	<p>God of our weary years,<br /> God of our silent tears,</p>
	<p>As African Americans, just as we have so much hope for our youth to 'lead the way' and to 'fulfill the dream,' we
		also have to daily face the reality that for countless reasons many of our youth, particularly if they are male and
		teenagers,somehow wind up being touched by the criminal justice system. This piece speaks to that issue.</p>
	<p>—Gwen Magee</p>

	<p>The face above the prison orange peering between bars—the same face as the eager graduate in Full of the
		Hope—stands in for a generation of black youth caught in persisting structural conditions of poverty and lack of
		education who may become a part of <a

			mass incarceration</a>.</p>
	<h3>God of Our Silent Tears I</h3>
	<p>An execution scene addressing the disproportionate percentage of African Americans given the death penalty and
		executed. It does not address the question of guilt or innocence, but questions whether or not our system of justiceIs
		truly equal for all.</p>

	<p>God of Our Silent Tears I takes viewers into the execution chamber, where the life force of a condemned man fades,
		marked by the receding image of his body as an overhead hand throws the switch to the electric chair. Magee has chosen
		to give this figure an African American face and not portray him as a featureless profile. The tableau reminds viewers
		that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States">capital punishment in America</a>
		imposes unequal racial judgment in society's name.</p>
	<h3>God of Our Silent Tears II</h3>
	<p>This companion piece looks at execution from another perspective—that of the family being left behind, for
		they, too, will suffer. Each of the three newspapers shown takes a different position—one is against capital
		punishment and also questions the politics of the trail and whether or not this man was railroaded for political
		reasons. Another paper takes the position that the evidence clearly proved his guilt and that he therefore should be
		executed.The third takes a middle of the road point of view.</p>

	<p>As the family of a condemned man waits, and the clock nears the appointed hour of midnight, God of Our Silent Tears
		II portrays the other side of the execution scene, that of the "family being left behind."</p>
	<h3>Thou Who Has Brought Us</h3>
	<p>Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;<br /> Thou who has by Thy might<br /> Led us into the light,<br /> Keep
		us forever in the path, we pray.<br /> Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,<br /> Lest,
		our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;<br /> Shadowed beneath Thy hand,<br /> May we forever
		stand.<br /> True to our God,<br /> True to our native land.</p>
	<p>Gwen Magee's series doesn't interpret the final lines of Lift Every Voice, but could be reprised by the hope
		expressed in Our New Day Begun. The spirit of Magee's work—informed by history but not overwhelmed by
		sorrow—complements the anthem that inspired her throughout her life.</p>

	<p>Infinity, the last quilt in the narrative sequence of Lift Every Voice and Sing: The Quilts of Gwendolyn Ann Magee,
		voices the joy Gwen Magee knew in her life, the love she experienced for her family and friends, and the legacy of her
		work. Early in the chronology of her work in fiber, Magee created Infinity as a Christmas gift for her husband, D. E.
		Magee. Just beginning to flex her creative muscles, she worked from a traditional quilt pattern that she altered to
		celebrate Dr. Magee's serious hobby of astronomy and his profession as an ophthalmologist.</p>

	<p>Infinity glows with intensity of color and precise geometry, successfully moving light across the surface while
		creating illusions of dimension through the manipulation of color and form. Dr. Magee's insistence that this was a
		work of art for the wall and not a bed covering marked a turning point from which Gwen Magee recognized and identified
		herself as an artist.</p>
	<p>Curator Ren&eacute; Barilleaux, who worked with Magee on her exhibition, Journey of the Spirit, at the Mississippi
		Museum of Art, sums up her life in the arts: "Gwen Magee was a rare combination of artist, advocate, and gentle
		spirit. In her life and in her art, she made monumental statements on those things about which she cared deeply."<a
