	<h2>Verse Two: Stony the Road We Trod</h2>
	<p>A slave coffle gives testimony to the miles and miles that men, women, and children were forced to trudge while
		shackled and chained.</p>

	<p>Moving into a second verse, Johnson's anthem turns toward history, as does Magee's imagery. She does not avoid the
		terrors of slavery as she translates words to visuals.</p>
	<p>A variegated deep red background and profiled black feet suggest the bloody treks of shackled slaves traveling to
		unknown destinations, before and after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Passage">Middle Passage</a>.
		The horizontal format of the quilt emphasizes the distance of these treks over perilous terrain. Interior contour
		lines emphasize the three-dimensiality of the trudging feet.</p>
	<h3>Bitter the Chastening Rod</h3>
	<p>The image of a chained woman being cruelly whipped even though her womb is heavy with child graphically illustrates
		the dehumanization of slaves.</p>

	<p>As she is whipped, a chained, pregnant, enslaved woman raises her voice in naked anguish. The stark black and white
		palette underscores the bitter verse as a featureless profiled figure represents numberless cruelties, violations, and
		abuses. Again, the interior linework on the silhouette emphasizes the contours of the writhing body.</p>

	<p>The flat plane of two-dimensional artwork cannot contain the emotions of When Hope Unborn Had Died. An anguished
		mother, weighed down by a heavy cotton sack, screams across the unfolding scene. A parasol obscures the couple that
		has purchased her child, as a high stepping horse moves their carriage, cart, and cargo diagonally toward the edge of
		the frame, soon to disappear.</p>
	<p>The action originates in the viewers' space as the three-dimensional sack of <a
			href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/video/the-cotton-economy-and-slavery/">cotton</a>
		drags out of the picture plane and anchors the mother in a powerless dimension. Viewers who approach this work are
		drawn into the narrative and to the figure whose futile scream floats above the carriage. Her featureless profile with
		its screaming mouth echoes the cries of countless mothers during generations of American slavery.</p>
	<p>The use of fabrics as identifiers is particularly strong here. The slave mother wears rough cloth resembling the
		homespun of field work; the cotton sack is of burlap. The shielding parasol is of shiny, luxury cloth; the dappled
		horse is an irregularly dyed fabric; and the sun is a shiny, intense yellow. The stark, stylized tree with its
		unnatural spiral foliage echoes the angry sun.</p>
	<p>Yet with a steady beat,<br /> Have not our weary feet<br /> Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?<br /> We
		have come over a way that with tears has been watered</p>
	<h3>We Have Come Over a Way That with Tears Has Been Watered</h3>
	<p>A slave ship plunges through ocean waters. Blazing in the sky the sun depicts the turmoil of the voyage. Slave trade
		routes are depicted by the quilting lines connecting Africa and the United States.</p>
	<p>—Gwen Magee</p>

	<p>A slave ship in full sail splitting the waters of the Atlantic evokes the Middle Passage in Over a Way that with
		Tears Has Been Watered. The atmosphere echoes the turmoil of the human cargo; a spinning sun of judgment emits jagged
		rays, filling the dark sky as turbulent waters crash the ship's hull.</p>
	<p>The white sails billow and propel the ship through deep waters. The sails and the hold of the ship, with the telltale
		name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Amistad">Amistad</a>, are surrounded by a nest of tangled white
		threadwork, suggesting the rising miasma of misery.</p>
	<p>Almost obscured in the chaos is the relentless path of map lines indicating slave voyages connecting Africa in the
		upper right corner to the Americas in the lower left.</p>
	<h3>Blood of the Slaughtered I and II</h3>
	<p>"Treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered . . ." The words haunted me for months—reverberating in
		my head over and over again; nine little words embodying a multiplicity of possible interpretations. But one meaning
		in particular resonated mercilessly. This single line . . . gripped me at the deepest core of my being and left me
		with no refuge.</p>

	<p>By their title The Blood of the Slaughtered I and II warns viewers that this work is difficult to imagine and to
		comprehend. The listing of names of documented <a
			href="http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/lynching">lynching victims</a> is Magee's
		memorial—a textile roll call for viewers to read and ponder.</p>
	<p>The names of the lynched, recorded by state, and localized within each state, brings the horrific history home. This
		is a memorial piece, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_Veterans_Memorial">Vietnam Wall</a> in cloth.
		With the spiraling tree in translucent overlay, fading body, and stark black and white palette, every element of this
		piece is stark and compelling.</p>
