	<h1>Overview</h1>
	<p >In this online exhibition catalog, Dorothy Moye presents and comments upon the textile art of Gwendolyn Ann Magee
		(1943–2011). This catalog accompanies the exhibition at the Gatewood Gallery of the University of North Carolina
		at Greensboro (September 11–November 8, 2014). Magee's extraordinary work includes a series of vivid, often
		harrowing, narrative quilts based on James Weldon Johnson's anthem "Lift Every Voice and Sing."</p >
